# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.1.38] — 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **LiteLLM circular import** (`partially initialized module 'litellm' … litellm_core_utils`): defer importing LiteLLM until the first LLM call, and require **LiteLLM ≥ 1.83.7** so older broken releases are not installed.

## [0.1.37] — 2026-04-24

### Changed

- **Single install for all SQL backends**: Core package dependencies now include Snowflake, Databricks, and BigQuery SQLAlchemy connectors (in addition to PostgreSQL). `pip install amx` is sufficient for every supported engine; optional `[snowflake]`, `[databricks]`, `[bigquery]`, and `[all-backends]` extras were removed.
- **Interactive `/db` workflow**: Entering `/db` shows which engines are supported and how to list profiles, switch the active profile, or add a new one. `/use-db` (no argument) lists each saved profile with `[backend]` and a connection summary. `/add-db-profile` and the setup wizard describe each engine when you pick PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Databricks, or BigQuery.

### Documentation

- README: installation from PyPI, multi-backend table, `db/adapters` in project layout, changelog pointer.
- This file added for release-focused notes; older entries remain in the README “Changelog” section.
